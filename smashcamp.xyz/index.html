  Starting in 2007, Smash Camp has been running for eighteen years (we don't talk about 2017 or 2024). This year we're bringing it back <s>because we were held at gunpoint</s> due to popular demand.
</p>
<p class="mt-1 mb-2">
  If you've attended Smash Camp in the past then you're probably already familiar with our usual festivities involving video games, trash-talking, and all around chaos.
  If you've held off on participating in the past or have lost interest over the years, now is the perfect time to join (or re-join!) in on the fun.
  After all, we might not bring it back! Maybe.
</p>
<h4 class="mt-3">Smash Camp Discord</h4>
<p class="mt-1 mb-2">
  If you're reading this and you're not in the Discord, what are you waiting for? Join now through the link below!
</p>
<div class="text-center mb-3">
  <a class="btn btn-blurple mx-1 btn-block btn-lg" role="button" href="https://discord.gg/Z97fENZP">Click HERE to join the Smash Camp Discord!</a>
</div>
<p class="mt-1 mb-2">
  The entirety of camp (including announcements) will take place over Discord. Thus, it is required to have a Discord account. Your cabins will also have Google Drives if you wish to use them.
</p>
<h4 class="mt-3">Pre-Camp</h4>
<p class="lead mt-1 mb-2">
  July 12<sup>th</sup> - July 13<sup>th</sup> 
</p>
<p class="mt-1 mb-2">
  The weekend before Smash Camp is considered the pre-camp period. This is when the leaders will sort you into your cabins. It is also when you will get to meet new people and get to know your cabin mates and come up with your cabin name. Each cabin is run by an individual counselor - get to know yours, as they are there to help you out!
</p>
<p class="mt-1 mb-2">
  Here are this year's counselors:
</p>
<p class="font-weight-bold mt-1 mb-2">
<span class="text-cabin-1">Cabin 1 - Ritvik</span><br>
<span class="text-cabin-2">Cabin 2 - Calaf</span><br>
<span class="text-cabin-3">Cabin 3 - scott</span><br>
<span class="text-cabin-4">Cabin 4 - Tant</span><br>
</p>
<h4 class="mt-3">Smash Camp 2025</h4>
<p class="lead mt-1 mb-2">
July 14<sup>th</sup> - July 18<sup>th</sup>
</p>
<p class="mt-1 mb-2">
  On Monday morning, the festivities will begin. Keep an eye on the announcements to make sure that you don't miss the events that are happening each day. Smash Camp consists of five days of activities that include competitive flash games, scavenger hunts, artistic challenges, writing challenges, tournaments and much more. There's something for everyone.
</p>
<p class="mt-1 mb-2">
  Taking part in these activities will earn you points for your cabin. Any questions or concerns you may have can be posted in the public <a href="https://discord.com/channels/198728949285650433/1109680605802811474">#smash-camp-questions</a> channel on our Discord server.
</p>
<p class="mt-1 mb-2">
  On the sixth day the scores will be added up, and one of the four cabins will be crowned as the victor. Don't fret if you're not part of the winning cabin though, as you will have a chance to win your own trophy in the annual Campie awards! The Campies are awarded to a selection of the most impressive campers and are voted on by the camp as a whole.
</p>
<h4 class="mt-3">Camp Leaders</h4>
<p class="mt-1 mb-2">
  Now it's time to meet the team that keeps Smash Camp running. These guys are always around to take your questions and help out if you get confused.
</p>
<p class="font-weight-bold text-leader mt-1 mb-2">
  ALI<br>
  Bossvelt<br>
  Curry<br>
  Nick<br>
  Thundawave<br>
</p>
<p class="mt-1 mb-2">
  Also a HUGE thank-you to <b>seaturtle</b> for letting us continue to use this site! He's going back to his roots as a camper this year, but we are forever grateful for his hard work and willingness to answer our questions.
</p>
<h4 class="mt-3">One Last Thing</h4>
<p class="mt-1 mb-2">
  We run Smash Camp during our own personal time, for our own enjoyment and the enjoyment of all you guys. Please remember that we're just humans and that we do have lives. We absolutely love hosting Smash Camp every year and that it's become such a dedicated community, but some people take it too far and get annoyed and/or abusive over some events that take place. Remember that it's all for a bit of fun and a good opportunity to make some new friends online.
</p>
<p class="mb-5 mt-1 mb-2">
  And that's all you need to know! We hope that you enjoy it!
